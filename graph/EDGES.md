# Concept Edges

Relationships between concept nodes.

## Core Architecture Cluster
```
context-assembly ←→ working-set          (assembles from)
context-assembly ←→ multi-dim-fusion     (powered by)
context-assembly ←→ tool-mediation       (enriched by)
context-assembly ←→ decay-model          (replaces compaction via)
context-assembly ←→ intermediary         (implemented by)
```

## Knowledge Substrate Cluster
```
epistemics-native ←→ multi-dim-fusion    (dimensions feed)
epistemics-native ←→ knowledge-lifecycle (lifecycle of)
epistemics-native ←→ federation          (enables)
knowledge-lifecycle ←→ progressive-summarization (follows)
knowledge-lifecycle ←→ lazy-compute      (driven by)
knowledge-lifecycle ←→ decay-model       (decay rules)
```

## Emergence Cluster
```
stigmergy ←→ progressive-summarization   (dual principles)
stigmergy ←→ emergent-ontology           (structure emerges via)
stigmergy ←→ lazy-compute                (compute follows use via)
stigmergy ←→ decay-model                 (relevance emerges via)
emergent-ontology ←→ knowledge-lifecycle (entities emerge through)
```

## Tool & Intent Cluster
```
tool-mediation ←→ intent-capture         (wraps with)
tool-mediation ←→ intermediary           (implemented by)
tool-mediation ←→ context-assembly       (enriches)
tool-mediation ←→ stigmergy              (hygiene through)
intent-capture ←→ working-set            (informs)
```

## Implementation Cluster
```
rust-engine ←→ multi-dim-fusion          (implements)
rust-engine ←→ lazy-compute              (enables)
rust-engine ←→ epistemics-native         (native in)
rust-engine ←→ intermediary              (is the)
```

## Trust & Sharing Cluster
```
federation ←→ privacy-sovereignty        (constrained by)
federation ←→ epistemics-native          (nested beliefs via)
privacy-sovereignty ←→ intermediary      (enforced by)
privacy-sovereignty ←→ knowledge-lifecycle (L0 never shares)
```

## Key Insight Edges
```
stigmergy + progressive-summarization = "structure emerges from use"
context-assembly + decay-model = "no more compaction"
tool-mediation + intent-capture = "tools get smarter over time"
intermediary = rust-engine = "the engine IS the intermediary"
```
